# SQL-Credit_Card_Transactions
In this project, we analyze credit card transactions to assess performance and usage patterns across different card types and expense categories. The dataset spans from April 10, 2014, to September 9, 2014, and includes four card types—Silver, Signature, Gold, and Platinum—as well as six expense categories: Entertainment, Food, Bills, Fuel, Travel, and Grocery. This analysis provides insights into spending behaviors and preferences across these dimensions.
